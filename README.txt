All the implementations are done in jupyter notebook (python)

Demo_model1: Training model 1
Demo_model2: Training model 2
Model_deployed: Deploy model 1 and 2

actions\: contains all the training folders and files. (I don't include the training files and folers inside this one for better download the whole files)

model\trained_model1\:
cnn_model1_architecture.h5: This file stores the structure of the trained CNN model 1. 

cnn_model1_weights.h5: This file contains the learned weights of the trained CNN model 1. 

model\trained_model2\:
cnn_model2_architecture.h5: This file stores the structure of the trained CNN model 2. 

model\ cnn_model: saved model 1
model\ cnn_model2: saved model 2

cnn_model2_weights.h5: This file contains the learned weights of the trained CNN model 2. 

ViTPose_pytorch\: contains the training model of ViTPose and picure for new datset.
